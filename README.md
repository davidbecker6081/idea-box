## Synopsis

In this project we were asked to create an application to keep track of thoughts and ideas.  The project involved use of HTML and CSS, jQuery and javascript, along with the integration of JSON and Local Storage. When the page loads, focus is immediately placed on the title input, allowing easier access for the user to begin inputting ideas.

## Usage

Users can input a title and description for an idea and by clicking the save button or pressing the enter key, the idea will be prepended to the page, and stored locally.  The user can change the quality level of the idea between three options: swill, plausible, and genius. The user can also edit both the title and description of already created ideas, as well as delete any ideas he/she no longer wants.  There is also a search bar, allowing the user to filter through ideas based on text inputted.

## History

* Fully responsive on all major devices
* Full functionality of local storage, including upon page reload
* All ideas are editable and will replace original idea object in local storage
* Search function filters through title, description, and quality in real time, displaying appropriately corresponding ideas even after user adds new ideas to the list.
* With (over)confidence
